					<p>Thika School of Medical and Health Sciences prides itself  on providing accessible, high quality education and workforce development opportunities that lead to careers in business, health, industrial, and public service.</p>
					<p>I must say that Health and technical Education in Kenya has undergone a paradigm shift in the last two decades. The colleges provide new choice of a career which not only empowers young minds to take up social cause but also the opportunities present in a growing globalized world. Health Education is in for exciting times and yet faces major challenges: to measure up to the huge expectations of the younger generation, to design contemporary curriculum for preparing Engineers/ Managers/ Scientists and Health workers for emerging challenges, to solve existing challenges and to compete internationally. All these challenges are not insurmountable. What is required is a clear vision and most importantly a belief that it could be achieved.</p>
					<p>
					In this regard the Thika School of Medical and Health Sciences has been established with a mandate to transform and redefine the face of Health education, thereby culminating into a confluence of thought, knowledge and practice to facilitate the fullest development of the individual. Our aim is to produce engineers, scientists and managers who are technically sound, professionally competent and socially relevant.</p>
					<p>	
					Our emphasis on discipline is unrelenting. While students have their own space but with all the requisite checks and balances. The physical infrastructure development on the campus is in tune with the rapid progress on the academic front and is significant step to be one of the leading institutions of technical education in the country.</p>

					<p>The key to that success is the young aspirant you who desire to join this college. The transformation of your mind with its limitless potential will make this College a class of its own. It is possible only if you share the dream and passion to achieve it. Procuring an admission in this college is not the achievement but to sustain the goal, learn and unlearn in the journey, to practice the profession with highest ethical standards and to involve pro-actively in the issues facing the society, is the real achievement.</p>
					<p>
					The Office of the Registrar implements College policies and procedures. The office maintains student records; issues transcripts; processes academic registration and processes grades; schedules examinations; certifies students for graduation; orders and distributes diplomas; verifies enrollment and graduation; approves and evaluates transfer, study leave and advanced placement credit; maintains the Academic Calendar; and supplies statistics and reports
					The Office’s mission is to ensure accuracy and confidentiality implement College policies and procedures, supply information, and provide efficient and attentive service to students, faculty, and administrative staff. We balance fair, equitable enforcement of policy with responsive, individual assistance.</p>
					<p>
					At the college, we treat all students and prospective students fairly, ensure student admission and selection procedures are based on merit principles and are open, fair and transparent. We provide a framework for the selection and admission of students who are capable of success in their chosen field of studies and comply with the entrance criteria for the government of Kenya.
					Expand awareness, recognition and increase visibility of the college, its programs, offerings, and events in an effort to promote student access and success. This is through our market niche “Career Oriented Health Sciences and business courses” supported by our broad goals:
					• Increase enrollment
					• Maximize student retention
					• Strengthen strategic communications
					• Maintain our brand name.
					I invite all of you to join us in this challenging experience to maximize the benefits and fulfilling the aspirations of the society and the mission of this college.</p>
